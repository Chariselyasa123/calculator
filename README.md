## Description

This calculator is made using [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). For
more-detail about Web Component [Click Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).

Why I use Web Component? Because I want to learn other ways to build web applications using custom elements
with [Web Component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). And also because I want to learn how
to use [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Shadow_DOM).

For styling, I use the design concept of Neumorphism. For more-detail about
Neumorphism, [Click Here](https://www.justinmind.com/ui-design/neumorphism). Neumorphism is not CSS framework, but it is
a concept that I use to design my Calculator App.
